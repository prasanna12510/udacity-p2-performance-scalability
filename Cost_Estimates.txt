Reduced Cost Estimates:
change db instance type with required or max threshold in terms of CPU or memory that can handle 50000 connections at a time
use standard GP2 SSD for RDS
reduced replicas for DB to 1 (MultiAZ)
change instance type for EC2(web and app server)


Increased Cost Estimates:
change db instance type with maximum cpu and memory
increase IOPS and storage size for DB
add more replicas for DB (MultiAZ)
increase instance type for EC2(web and app server)
